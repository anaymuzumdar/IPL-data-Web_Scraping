# WebSraping_&_Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Project_on_IPL_Batsmen_Data_using_Python
A webscraping project on IPL Batsmen Data from the official website of IPL.
The Objective of the project was to find out the best performing batsmen and find out their records.
Data taken of top 100 batsmen who have scored most runs throughout every season from 2008 till 2020.
An exploratory data analysis is performed on the dataframe which consists of cleaning the data for gaining further analysis/observations like removing missing values, converting the data into the required datatype, etc.
The analysis/observations are based on some paramenters like highest runs, best batting average, highest strike-rate, most fours or sixes in a particular season and throughout every season.
